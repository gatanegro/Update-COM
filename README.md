Update in  Collatz conjecture with quantum and cosmic dynamics through Oscillatory Field Theory (OFT). By introducing scalable amplitude LZ = 1.23498 and fixed curvature coupling HQS} = 23.5\%, we resolve infinite recursion in Collatz sequences, derive Planck and gravitational constants, and predict cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. Validations confirm energy quantization, relativistic Doppler shifts, and gravitational emergence from oscillatory energy density gradients.

Oscillatory Field Theory (OFT) unifies beta decay and neutrino-electron scattering through the FIELD, a spaceless/timeless construct governed by scalable amplitude LZ} = 1.23498  and curvature coupling HQS} = 23.5 %
Simulations validate FIELD-mediated energy redistribution, angular deflection, and neutrino oscillations, aligning with experimental data.
